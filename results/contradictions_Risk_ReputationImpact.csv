Such facilities must receive a 0% inflow rate, meaning that this scenario does not consider inflows from committed credit or liquidity facilities. This is to reduce the contagion risk of liquidity shortages at one bank causing shortages at other banks and to reflect the risk that other banks may not be in a position to honour credit facilities, or may decide to incur the legal and reputational risk involved in not honouring the commitment, in order to conserve their own liquidity or reduce their exposure to that bank.|credit facility liquidity facility contingent funding facility bank hold institution purpose assumed able drawn facility must receive inflow rate meaning scenario consider inflow committed credit liquidity facility reduce contagion risk liquidity shortage one bank causing shortage bank reflect risk bank may position honour credit facility may decide incur legal reputational risk involved honouring commitment order conserve liquidity reduce exposure bank|10|Risk_ReputationImpact|34|0.9603397250175476|0.49426427483558655|Guidelines on institutions stress testing (EBA-GL-2018-04).di.json_p42_i7|Guidelines on institutions stress testing (EBA-GL-2018-04).di.json|e) the internalisation of risks related to specific activities, as in the case of prime brokerage where symmetry, to a certain extent, might be required between the lending side and the borrowing side of securities, i.e. customer long positions are funded using the proceeds from customer short trades.

BaselFramework.di.json_p1282_i4|BaselFramework.di.json|29 Reputational risk can be defined as the risk arising from negative perception on the part of customers, counterparties, shareholders, investors, debt-holders, market analysts, other relevant parties or regulators that can adversely affect a bank's ability to maintain existing, or establish new, business relationships and continued access to sources of funding (eg through the interbank or securitisation markets). Reputational risk is multidimensional and reflects the perception of other market participants. Furthermore, it exists throughout the organisation and exposure to reputational risk is essentially a function of the adequacy of the bank's internal risk management processes, as well as the manner and efficiency with which management responds to external influences on bank-related transactions.|reputational risk defined risk arising negative perception part customer counterparties shareholder investor debtholders market analyst relevant party regulator adversely affect bank ability maintain existing establish new business relationship continued access source funding eg interbank securitisation market reputational risk multidimensional reflects perception market participant furthermore exists throughout organisation exposure reputational risk essentially function adequacy bank internal risk management process well manner efficiency management responds external influence bankrelated transaction|16|Risk_ReputationImpact|29|0.9531204700469971|0.570098340511322|Final Report on Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for SREP and supervisory stress testing.di.json_p270_i7|Final Report on Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for SREP and supervisory stress testing.di.json|The definition of step-in risk given in recital 9 of the RTS on Prudential consolidation (EBA/RTS/2021/04), i.e. the possibility that an institution may decide to provide financial support to an unconsolidated entity that is facing stress, even in the absence of, or in excess of, any contractual obligations, is not overlapping with the other subcategories of risk mentioned by the respondents (i.e. reputational risk, strategic and business risk). In line with the general principles applicable to the SREP, competent authorities should carry out a comprehensive assessment of risks faced by the institution, while avoiding any double counting. The assessment of reputational risk to be performed by competent authorities has the purpose of identifying the risk to which the institution is exposed and the members of the management body clearly have an influence on this risk. Nevertheless, having done the assessment, the competent authorities have to decide whether and what type of measures (qualitative or quantitative) are most adequate to address this source of risk, and also take into account actions already taken.
BaselFramework.di.json_p1282_i6|BaselFramework.di.json|31 Prior to the 2007 upheaval, many banks failed to recognise the reputational risk associated with their off-balance sheet vehicles. In stressed conditions some firms went beyond their contractual obligations to support their sponsored securitisations and off-balance sheet vehicles. A bank should incorporate the exposures that could give rise to reputational risk into its assessments of whether the requirements under the securitisation framework have been met and the potential adverse impact of providing implicit support.|prior upheaval many bank failed recognise reputational risk associated offbalance sheet vehicle stressed condition firm went beyond contractual obligation support sponsored securitisations offbalance sheet vehicle bank incorporate exposure could give rise reputational risk assessment whether requirement securitisation framework met potential adverse impact providing implicit support|10|Risk_ReputationImpact|48|0.9519861340522766|0.4968605637550354|L_2012150EN.01007801_1.json_p1_i55|L_2012150EN.01007801_1.json|The Commission considers that the price of SEK 17 million paid by FABV to Chips AB at the time of its purchase of the Facility does not constitute compelling evidence of the market value.

The EBA 'Guidelines on limits on exposures to shadow banking entities' define prudential expectations regarding groups of shadow banking entities. In this context, institutions should give due consideration to the fact that elements of control among these shadow banking entities will most likely consist not of equity ties but rather of a different type of relationship, i.e. situations of de facto control or relationships characterised by contractual obligations, implicit support or potential reputational risk (e.g. sponsorship or even branding). 11|guideline apply exposure shadow banking way apply exposure client institution pay particular attention assessing connection among shadow banking entity eba guideline limit exposure shadow banking entity define prudential expectation regarding group shadow banking entity context institution give due consideration fact element control among shadow banking entity likely consist equity tie rather different type relationship ie situation de facto control relationship characterised contractual obligation implicit support potential reputational risk eg sponsorship even branding|19|Risk_ReputationImpact|44|0.9512574672698975|0.62056565284729|L_2006085EN.01000101_1.json_p1_i148|L_2006085EN.01000101_1.json|In order to verify whether the actual price difference between the two operators reflects market conditions a correction factor was therefore applied to attempt to neutralise TV2's stronger position on the market. This weighting factor was derived from calculations by media agencies and reflects the different coverage in the target group attainable by purchasing 100 TRP 21-50 from TvDanmark and TV2. TvDanmark is on average slightly below 70 % of TV2's reach (in purchasing 100 TRP 21-50). If this factor is applied the prices are nearer to converging, while TV2's price remains slightly higher than that of TvDanmark. The difference in price thus seems to reflect market conditions. However, this result has to be treated with caution since the weighting factor cannot possibly adjust all the differences between the stations.

This weighting factor was derived from calculations by media agencies and reflects the different coverage in the target group attainable by purchasing 100 TRP 21-50 from TvDanmark and TV2. TvDanmark is on average slightly below 70 % of TV2's reach (in purchasing 100 TRP 21-50). If this factor is applied the prices are nearer to converging, while TV2's price remains slightly higher than that of TvDanmark. The difference in price thus seems to reflect market conditions. However, this result has to be treated with caution since the weighting factor cannot possibly adjust all the differences between the stations.

This weighting factor was derived from calculations by media agencies and reflects the different coverage in the target group attainable by purchasing 100 TRP 21-50 from TvDanmark and TV2. TvDanmark is on average slightly below 70 % of TV2's reach (in purchasing 100 TRP 21-50). If this factor is applied the prices are nearer to converging, while TV2's price remains slightly higher than that of TvDanmark. The difference in price thus seems to reflect market conditions. However, this result has to be treated with caution since the weighting factor cannot possibly adjust all the differences between the stations.

The Commission has already explained in the opening decision that Chips AB accepted a price lower than the estimated market value of the Facility because it wanted to avoid damage to its corporate reputation deriving from the closure of the Facility and the job losses that would have followed, It also wished to avail itself of the opportunity of a quick sale to close the book on its Topp operations. A private market operator not having these constraints (which are specific to Chips AB) would have requested a higher price. For those reasons, the Commission does not deem it necessary to reply to the argument of Hammar (summarised in recital 27 of the present Decision), which moreover concerns a point which is not part of the formal investigation.
