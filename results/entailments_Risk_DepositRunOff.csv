CELEX_32014L0059_EN_TXT.di.json_p13_i11|CELEX_32014L0059_EN_TXT.di.json|This Directive adopts a 'top down' approach to the determination of the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) within a group. The approach further recognises that resolution action is applied at the level of the individual legal person, and that it is imperative that loss-absorbing capacity is located in, or accessible to, the legal person within the group in which losses occur. To that end, resolution authorities should ensure that loss-absorbing capacity within a group is distributed across the group in accordance with the level of risk in its constituent legal persons. The minimum requirement necessary for each individual subsidiary should be separately assessed. Furthermore, resolution authorities should ensure that all capital and liabilities which are counted towards the consolidated minimum requirement are located in entities where losses are liable to occur, or are otherwise available to absorb losses. This Directive should allow for a multiple-point-of-entry or a single-point-of-entry resolution. The MREL should reflect the resolution strategy which is appropriate to a group in accordance with the resolution plan. In particular, the MREL should be required at the appropriate level in the group in order to reflect a multiple-point-of-entry approach or single-point-of-entry-approach contained in the resolution plan while keeping in mind that there could be circumstances where an approach different from that contained in the plan is used as it would allow, for instance, reaching the resolution objectives more efficiently. Against that background, regardless of whether a group has chosen the single-point- of-entry or the multiple-point-of entry approach, all institutions and other legal persons in the group where required by the resolution authorities should, at all times, have a robust MREL so as to avoid the risk of contagion or a bank run.|directive adopts top approach determination minimum requirement fund eligible liability mrel within group approach recognises resolution action applied level individual legal person imperative lossabsorbing capacity located accessible legal person within group loss occur end resolution authority ensure lossabsorbing capacity within group distributed across group accordance level risk constituent legal person minimum requirement necessary individual subsidiary separately assessed furthermore resolution authority ensure capital liability counted towards consolidated minimum requirement located entity loss liable occur otherwise available absorb loss directive allow multiplepointofentry singlepointofentry resolution mrel reflect resolution strategy appropriate group accordance resolution plan particular mrel required appropriate level group order reflect multiplepointofentry approach singlepointofentryapproach contained resolution plan keeping mind could circumstance approach different contained plan used would allow instance reaching resolution objective efficiently background regardless whether group chosen singlepoint ofentry multiplepointof entry approach institution legal person group required resolution authority time robust mrel avoid risk contagion bank run|7|Risk_DepositRunOff|21|0.9999998807907104|0.9653708934783936|L_2014173EN.01019001_1.json_p1_i84|L_2014173EN.01019001_1.json|This Directive adopts a top down approach to the determination of the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) within a group.
