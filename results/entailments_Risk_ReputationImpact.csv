BaselFramework.di.json_p1282_i4|BaselFramework.di.json|29 Reputational risk can be defined as the risk arising from negative perception on the part of customers, counterparties, shareholders, investors, debt-holders, market analysts, other relevant parties or regulators that can adversely affect a bank's ability to maintain existing, or establish new, business relationships and continued access to sources of funding (eg through the interbank or securitisation markets). Reputational risk is multidimensional and reflects the perception of other market participants. Furthermore, it exists throughout the organisation and exposure to reputational risk is essentially a function of the adequacy of the bank's internal risk management processes, as well as the manner and efficiency with which management responds to external influences on bank-related transactions.|reputational risk defined risk arising negative perception part customer counterparties shareholder investor debtholders market analyst relevant party regulator adversely affect bank ability maintain existing establish new business relationship continued access source funding eg interbank securitisation market reputational risk multidimensional reflects perception market participant furthermore exists throughout organisation exposure reputational risk essentially function adequacy bank internal risk management process well manner efficiency management responds external influence bankrelated transaction|16|Risk_ReputationImpact|16|0.9467002153396606|0.7016242146492004|Final Report on Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for SREP and supervisory stress testing.di.json_p22_i3|Final Report on Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for SREP and supervisory stress testing.di.json|'Reputational risk' means the current or prospective risk to the institution's earnings, own funds or liquidity arising from damage to the institution's reputation.
BaselFramework.di.json_p1283_i2|BaselFramework.di.json|33 Reputational risk also may affect a bank's liabilities, since market confidence and a bank's ability to fund its business are closely related to its reputation. For instance, to avoid damaging its reputation, a bank may call its liabilities even though this might negatively affect its liquidity profile. This is particularly true for liabilities that are components of regulatory capital, such as hybrid/subordinated debt. In such cases, a bank's capital position is likely to suffer.|reputational risk also may affect bank liability since market confidence bank ability fund business closely related reputation instance avoid damaging reputation bank may call liability even though might negatively affect liquidity profile particularly true liability component regulatory capital hybridsubordinated debt case bank capital position likely suffer|10|Risk_ReputationImpact|16|0.9537361860275269|0.7549148201942444|Final Report on Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for SREP and supervisory stress testing.di.json_p22_i3|Final Report on Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for SREP and supervisory stress testing.di.json|'Reputational risk' means the current or prospective risk to the institution's earnings, own funds or liquidity arising from damage to the institution's reputation.

L_2016282EN.01005301_1.json_p1_i42|L_2016282EN.01005301_1.json|The Netherlands have questioned the impact of any aid on the internal market for clubs not playing football at European level and more especially for MVV. In this regard, the Commission points out that MVV is a potential participant in European football tournaments each year. Even as a second league club it is in principle able to influence the contest for the national football cup and to win the cup, which would allow it to play for the European cup the year after. Over a short period of time, even a low ranking football club can advance to a higher levelThis has in fact been demonstrated by another Dutch professional football club, PEC Zwolle, which also played in the second league in 2010/2011. PEC was promoted to the first league in 2012/2013 and in 2013/2014 it won the national football cup entitling it to play at European level in 2014/2015. . The Commission further points out that professional football clubs deploy economic activities in several markets other than participating in football competitions, such as the transfer market for professional players, publicity, sponsorship, merchandising or media coverage. Aid to a professional football club strengthens its position on each of those markets, most of which cover several Member States. Therefore, if state resources are used to provide a selective advantage to a professional football club, such aid is likely to have the potential of distorting competition and to affect trade between Member States within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the TreatyCommission Decisions regarding Germany of 20 March 2013 on Multifunktionsarena der Stadt Erfurt (Case SA. 35135 (2012/N)), point 12, and Multifunktionsarena der Stadt Jena (Case SA. 35440 (2012/N)), summary notices in OJ C 140, 18. 5. 2013, p. 1, and of 2 October 2013 on Fußballstadion Chemnitz (Case SA. 36105 (2013/N)), summary notice in OJ C 50, 21. 2. 2014, p. 1. .
