As the result of mass hysteria triggered by media reports, BAWAG-PSK had no chance to hinder the collapse of its savings deposit business. The State aid had not, therefore, in any manner distorted the competition in favour of BAWAG-PSK. In itself, this bank run, leading to reduced market shares for BAWAG-PSK, is regarded by Austria as a mitigating measure.|concerning loss market share result bank run austria view reduction sight deposit saving deposit around eur billion end september june already considerably weakened market position bank result mass hysteria triggered medium report bawagpsk chance hinder collapse saving deposit business state aid therefore manner distorted competition favour bawagpsk bank run leading reduced market share bawagpsk regarded austria mitigating measure|16|Risk_DepositRunOff|15|0.9346306324005127|0.5635215044021606|L_2010112EN.01003801_1.json_p1_i73|L_2010112EN.01003801_1.json|According to the United Kingdom, the third party comments on pricing of savings products do not take into account NR’s depleted retail deposit base following the bank run in September 2007. In order to stabilise the balance sheet of NR, it should be allowed to build-up its retail deposit base. The United Kingdom points out that a UK market share cap of 1,5 % on retail deposits is in place. This cap will prevent NR from pricing too aggressively and will simultaneously limit the impact NR will have on the savings market. The United Kingdom also submits that NR has not followed an aggressive pricing strategy in its retail deposit products, evidenced by the fact that NR has not ranked within the top 3 in the Moneyfacts savings tables since the Competitive Framework was introduced.

In this respect, the BNB sent a letter to the Commission on 12 October 2011 reporting the serious difficulties that DBB/Belfius had experienced in early 2011 because of withdrawals of deposits and a substantial reduction of non-securitised financing. In view of the systemic importance of DBB/Belfius for the Belgian and European financial sector, and the disturbances taking place in the financial markets, a measure to safeguard DBB/Belfius was necessary. The purchase of DBB/Belfius would make it possible to prevent a serious loss of public confidence, with the attendant risk of a run on the bank, which would in turn trigger a serious disturbance of the banking system as a whole both in Belgium and throughout Europe.

Only a few weeks were available to assess in depth the Bank's financial situation and make an offer. A run on the bank had started, creating a major danger for the liquidity of the bank. A continuation of the development for even a short period of time would have had lethal consequences for BAWAG-PSK. The time constraint, associated to the significant amount of the required guarantee, made any intervention by a private operator extremely difficult, if not at all possible.|commission also consider severe time constraint existed aprilmay private guarantor would intervene week available assess depth bank financial situation make offer run bank started creating major danger liquidity bank continuation development even short period time would lethal consequence bawagpsk time constraint associated significant amount required guarantee made intervention private operator extremely difficult possible|8|Risk_DepositRunOff|19|0.9383029341697693|0.8858548402786255|L_2014110EN.01000101_1.json_p1_i352|L_2014110EN.01000101_1.json|In October 2012, Belgium stressed that the purchase of DBB/Belfius by the Belgian State was becoming urgent for reasons of financial stability.

The savings deposits during the same period were reduced by EUR 4 billion (market share sank by almost […] percentage points to […] %). While this bank run may not be fully comparable to a compensation measure in the meaning of the guidelines, it considerably reduced the most important refinancing source for BAWAG-PSK.

In particular, Parex banka became increasingly involved in the CIS markets, relying excessively on large, short-term non-resident deposits. The financial crisis severely affected emerging markets including the CIS countries, and rumours circulated regarding the ability of Parex banka to refinance its syndicated loans maturing in February 2009. A combination of these events resulted in a loss of depositor confidence especially among non-resident clients prompting a run on the bank. The bank run reached a peak daily outflow of up to EUR 100 million and was not halted by the bank’s partial nationalisation. It resulted in a fall in deposits of 36 % compared to the end of 2007, causing severe liquidity crisis. To prevent a further outflow of deposits, restrictions on withdrawals were imposed by the Latvian regulator, the Finance and Capital Markets Commission.|although parex banka historically profitable institution strong banking franchise latvia bank management chose inadequate business strategy made highrisk decision face intense competition sophisticated subsidiary foreign bank particular parex banka became increasingly involved ci market relying excessively large shortterm nonresident deposit financial crisis severely affected emerging market including ci country rumour circulated regarding ability parex banka refinance syndicated loan maturing february combination event resulted loss depositor confidence especially among nonresident client prompting run bank bank run reached peak daily outflow eur million halted bank partial nationalisation resulted fall deposit compared end causing severe liquidity crisis prevent outflow deposit restriction withdrawal imposed latvian regulator finance capital market commission|16|Risk_DepositRunOff|19|0.9420536756515503|0.8543316125869751|L_2014110EN.01000101_1.json_p1_i352|L_2014110EN.01000101_1.json|In October 2012, Belgium stressed that the purchase of DBB/Belfius by the Belgian State was becoming urgent for reasons of financial stability.

However, it explained that deposit guarantee schemes are necessary to avoid bank runs and a disturbance of the financial markets. The Belgian State contended the cooperative guarantee scheme was needed to avoid a reduction of public confidence in the Belgian financial system. The basic characteristics of cooperative shares as savings products and the fact that more than half of the funds held by cooperatives are invested in banks enhanced their similarity to deposits and highlighted their importance for the Belgian banking system. An uncontrolled default of financial cooperatives would have had a snowball effect on all financial institutions and the Belgian economy. Not to provide the same level of protection for financial cooperatives' shares as for basic deposits would have entailed the same risk as not providing protection to deposits. It would have had a great impact on the public confidence in all deposit products in Belgium and create a systemic risk. In support of its arguments, the Belgian State referred to the fact that the number of shareholders (natural persons) in financial cooperatives is large relative to the total population in BelgiumThe Belgian State explained that ARCO has 800000 individual shareholders, Cera over 400000, Lanbokas/Agricaisse 150000 and ArgenCo almost 70000. .

Further, in the current macroeconomic context of Latvia it is difficult to attract external funding. The total deposits of the residents in the Baltic states are significantly lower than the loan portfolio thereof, whereas Parex banka’s main competitors receive funding from their parent companies established in other countries (mostly Sweden). Thus, Citadele banka has to retain some funding base abroad (in Sweden and Germany).|regard two deposittaking branch sweden germany transferred citadele banka latvia explained result run bank significant share baltic funding bank depleted current macroeconomic context latvia difficult attract external funding total deposit resident baltic state significantly lower loan portfolio thereof whereas parex bankas main competitor receive funding parent company established country mostly sweden thus citadele banka retain funding base abroad sweden germany|8|Risk_DepositRunOff|19|0.9371993541717529|0.8037128448486328|L_2014110EN.01000101_1.json_p1_i352|L_2014110EN.01000101_1.json|In October 2012, Belgium stressed that the purchase of DBB/Belfius by the Belgian State was becoming urgent for reasons of financial stability.
