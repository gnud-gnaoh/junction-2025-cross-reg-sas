This implies that the effective maturity of all the tranches of the synthetic securitisation may differ from that of the underlying exposures. Banks that synthetically securitise exposures held on their balance sheet by purchasing tranched credit protection must treat such maturity mismatches in the following manner: For securitisation exposures that are assigned a risk weight of 1250%, maturity mismatches are not taken into account. For all other securitisation exposures, the bank must apply the maturity mismatch treatment set forth in CRE22.10 to CRE22.14. When the exposures being hedged have different maturities, the longest maturity must be used.
BaselFramework.di.json_p266_i5|BaselFramework.di.json|33 For collateral to be recognised in the simple approach, it must be pledged for at least the life of the exposure and it must be marked to market and revalued with a minimum frequency of six months. Those portions of exposures collateralised by the market value of recognised collateral receive the risk weight applicable to the collateral instrument. The risk weight on the collateralised portion is subject to a floor of 20% except under the conditions specified in CRE22.36 to CRE22.39. The remainder of the exposure must be assigned the risk weight appropriate to the counterparty. Maturity mismatches are not allowed under the simple approach (see CRE22.10 to CRE22.11).|collateral recognised simple approach must pledged least life exposure must marked market revalued minimum frequency six month portion exposure collateralised market value recognised collateral receive risk weight applicable collateral instrument risk weight collateralised portion subject floor except condition specified remainder exposure must assigned risk weight appropriate counterparty maturity mismatch allowed simple approach see|19|Risk_MaturityMismatch|10|0.9456149935722351|0.6813342571258545|BaselFramework.di.json_p440_i2|BaselFramework.di.json|terminate.
